Elastic Beanstalk for Ruby makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale your Ruby web applications using Amazon Web Services\. Elastic Beanstalk is available to anyone developing or hosting a web application using Ruby\. This section provides step\-by\-step instructions for deploying a sample application to Elastic Beanstalk using the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface \(EB CLI\), and then updating the application to use the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web application frameworks\.

The topics in this chapter assume some knowledge of Elastic Beanstalk environments\. If you haven't used Elastic Beanstalk before, try the getting started tutorial to learn the basics\.
