With the AWS SDK for PHP, you can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package complete with the AWS PHP library, code samples, and documentation\. You can build PHP applications on top of APIs that take the complexity out of coding directly against web services interfaces\. The all\-in\-one library provides PHP developer\-friendly APIs that hide much of the lower\-level tasks associated with programming for the AWS cloud, including authentication, request retries, and error handling\. Practical examples are provided in PHP for how to use the libraries to build applications\. Online video tutorials and reference documentation are provided to help you learn how to use the libraries and code samples\.
