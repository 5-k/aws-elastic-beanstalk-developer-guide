# branch<a name="branch"></a>

**Note**  
 This version of the EB CLI and its documentation have been replaced with version 3 \(in this section, EB CLI 3 represents version 3 and later of the EB CLI\)\. For information on the new version, see \. 

## Description<a name="branchdescription"></a>

Maps a Git branch to a new or existing Elastic Beanstalk environment and configures the mapped environment through a series of prompts\. You must first create the Git branch\. If no branches exist in the Git repository, eb displays a message that prompts you to run the `branch` command\. Eb then attempts to start the application specified in the default settings in the optionsettings file\.

To map a Git branch, first run `git checkout <branch>`, specifying the name of the Git branch you want to map\. Then run `eb branch`\. If the branch has never been mapped to an Elastic Beanstalk environment, you'll have the option to copy the most current environment settings to the new environment\.

Consider the following additional information about using `branch`:

+ If you run `eb init` on an existing repository and change the application name, region, or solution stack, the command resets all existing branch mappings\. Run `branch` again to map each branch to an environment\.

+ You can map different Git branches to the same Elastic Beanstalk environment but in most cases maintain one\-to\-one relationships between branches and environments\.

For a tutorial that describes how to use eb to deploy a Git branch to Elastic Beanstalk, see [Deploying a Git Branch to a Specific Environment](command-reference-branch-environment.md)\.

None

## Example<a name="branchexample"></a>

The following example maps the Git branch `master` to a new environment called MyApp\-env\-test, using the same settings as a previously created environment called Myapp\-env\. Replace the red placeholder text with your own values\.

```
PROMPT> eb branch 

The current branch is "master".
Enter an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment name (auto-generated value is "MyApp-master-env"): MyApp-env-test
Do you want to copy the settings from environment "MyApp-env" for the new branch? [y/n]: y
PROMPT> eb status
Environment "MyApp-env-test" is not running.
