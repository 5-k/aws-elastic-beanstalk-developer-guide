# Configuring VPC with Elastic Beanstalk<a name="using-features.managing.vpc"></a>

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) enables you to define a virtual network in your own isolated section within the AWS Cloud, known as a *virtual private cloud \(VPC\)*\. Using Amazon VPC, you can deploy a new class of web applications on Elastic Beanstalk, including internal web applications \(such as your recruiting application\), web applications that connect to an on\-premises database \(using a VPN connection\), and private web service backends\. Elastic Beanstalk launches your AWS resources, such as instances, into your VPC\. Your VPC closely resembles a traditional network, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS\. You have complete control over your VPC\. You can select the IP address range, create subnets, and configure routes and network gateways\. To protect the resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists\. For more information about Amazon VPC, see the [Amazon VPC User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/)\.

You can view your environment's VPC configuration by viewing the **VPC** settings on the environment's **Configuration** page\. If you don't see the **VPC** settings on this page, your current environment isn't inside a VPC either because you are using a legacy container or you created the Elastic Beanstalk environment outside of a VPC\. To learn how to migrate to a nonlegacy container to use Amazon VPC with Elastic Beanstalk, see [Migrating Your Application from a Legacy Container Type](using-features.migration.md)\. To learn how to create your VPC and launch your Elastic Beanstalk environment inside your VPC, see [Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](vpc.md)\.
