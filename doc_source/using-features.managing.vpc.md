# Configuring VPC with Elastic Beanstalk<a name="using-features.managing.vpc"></a>

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) enables you to define a virtual network in your own isolated section within the Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) cloud, known as a *virtual private cloud \(VPC\)*\. Using VPC, you can deploy a new class of web applications on Elastic Beanstalk, including internal web applications \(such as your recruiting application\), web applications that connect to an on\-premise database \(using a VPN connection\), as well as private web service back ends\. Elastic Beanstalk launches your AWS resources, such as instances, into your VPC\. Your VPC closely resembles a traditional network, with the benefits of using AWS's scalable infrastructure\. You have complete control over your VPC; you can select the IP address range, create subnets, and configure routes and network gateways\. To protect the resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists\. For more information about Amazon VPC, go to the [Amazon VPC User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/)\.

You can view your environment's VPC configuration by viewing the **VPC** settings on the environment's **Configuration** page\. If you do not see the **VPC** settings on the **Configuration** page, your current environment is not inside a VPC either because you are using a legacy container or you created the Elastic Beanstalk environment outside a VPC\. To learn how to migrate to a nonlegacy container to use Amazon VPC with Elastic Beanstalk, see [Migrating Your Application from a Legacy Container Type](using-features.migration.md)\. To learn how to create your VPC and launch your Elastic Beanstalk environment inside your VPC, see [Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](vpc.md)\.
